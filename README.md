## Reflection
### Wins
- Quite like the Riot Games/Valorant inspired design
- The fact that I managed to center the picture in a div (it's so easy when you know `background-image` and `background-position` ðŸ˜­)
- First attempt in making a somewhat responsive page

### Hurdles
- Still confused with the usage of minimum and maximum width and height (Why does each behave differently in different situations?)
- Used sibling selectors but realized that I could do so much more with it (like recreating conditionals in CSS!)
- Lack of JS knowledge to make a robust password confirmer

### Takeaways
- Styling form controls is tedious af -- but that makes it more rewarding when you're done.
- I need to learn more about manipulating image on a page (in this case: how to keep it from shrinking when the width of page is getting smaler)
- Plan before I code: I had to start afresh in the middle of the way and start doing things methodically (e.g. create a skeleton structure before doing any styling)
